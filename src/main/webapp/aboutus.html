    <ul>
      <li>Summer Feelz:  </li>
        <ul>
          <li> I tried to look up a poem about summer in the city and I found one from Emma Lazurus called  
            <i>Long Island sound</i>. As I was reading it, I realized that it wasn't as accurate as of a description... so I wanted to modernize it a bit... <br>
            I call it <i>East River sound</i> <br>
              I see it as it looked one afternoon <br>
              In August,â€”by a fresh soft breeze, thick and humid, o'erblown. <br>
              The swiftness of the tide, the boom of water hitting cement<br> 
              the gull picking at the Tampax box <br>
              A far-off ferry spewing black clouds <br>
              The shining waters with oil rainbows strewn, <br>
              The fisherman speaking languages of other lands, Stuyvesant cove, <br>
              The semi-circle of the FDR. <br>
              No luminous grasses, just the merry sun <br>
              In the grave sky; the sparkle far and wide, <br>
              Laughter of teethless women, cheerful chirp <br>
              Of mating rats, and low lisp of a distrot old man,<br>
              Light summer clouds fantastical as sleep <br>
              Changing unnoted while I gazed thereon. <br>
              All these fair sounds and sights I made my own.</li>
