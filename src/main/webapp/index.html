    <p>Hello! My name is Naledi Kekana. I am a rising senior at Barnard College in New York City. I love stand up comedy, walking around New York, and babysitting. I love to watch The Office, Bob's Burgers, 90 Day Fiance and its spinoffs, Whose Line is It Anyway, as well as Last Week Tonight with John Oliver. </p>
