        Hi everyone, My Name is Donat Kapesa and a Software Engineering student at McGill University. I was born and raised in D.R. Congo, did my high school in Ghana and now my family Madagascar (never in my life would I have guess that I’d live in Madagascar).
My interests? I love watching and playing football, or soccer for Americans (lmk if you’re a Real Madrid or Ronaldo fan and we can be friends). I also like listening to all sorts of music like Hip Hop, Afro Pop, EDM, Pop, Grime literally anything that sounds good in my ears. I also like to dance and I played guitar for a year but I plan on getting back to it this summer? 

TV Shows/Movies? Power, Game of Thrones, Vikings, Silicon Valley, Fresh Prince of Bel Air, Narcos Marvel and DC movies etc…

I also like to play video games, currently playing God Of War. Some of my favourites ever include FIFA, The Last of Us and Red Dead Redemption as well
